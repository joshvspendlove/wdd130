      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this website is to be my personal web portfolio. The home page should be an introduction of me and my various skills and hobbies. People that navigate to this page will get a basic overview of what I am capable of. In some ways, this home page will be a resume.
        <br><br>
        This page will answer questions about the skills I have, how I have used these skills in my life, and how these skills play into my hobbies. I want this first page to build suspense in the visitor, drawing them towards my other pages.
        <br><br>
        This page will primarily be for viewing. Visitors will come here to learn more about me and if they so choose, they may click some of the available links and dive deeper into my portfolio.
        <br><br>
        The only information necessary for the visitor will be to know which links are clickable.
        <br><br>
        This website will be my portfolio on the web. It will be the only place people can go to learn about my accomplishments. They may be able to find some information on social media, but this will be a more complete compilation of my projects and achievements.

      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img class="med-img" src="images/me.jpeg" alt="portrait for homepage">
        <img class="med-img" src="images/family_photo.jpeg" alt="family photo for homepage">

      </ul>
      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p>
        The photography page will cover my accomplishments as a photographer. People that navigate to this page will have the opportunity to view my work and enjoy the beauty that I have found in the world. I also hope to include my thoughts about the pictures, allowing viewers some insight into my way of thinking. 
        <br><br>
        When people come to this page, I hope they find answers to questions such as: What is beauty and where can I find it? Do I need to travel far, or can I find it in my own back yard?
        <br><br>
        The primary purpose of this second page is just to enjoy the beauty I’ve captured, and to appreciate the unseen or unappreciated beauty of this world. Viewers will also have the opportunity to read about each piece, learning more about why I chose to display it.
        <br><br>
        I hope to make page intuitive, providing hints as to where the user can click for additional information and details. These hints may include tooltips, ellipses, or buttons. I want this page to be clean, leaving out obnoxious distractions.
        <br><br>
        As the purpose of this website will be my own personal portfolio, this site will be the only place people can come to learn about me and my accomplishments. If people want to view photos I have taken, they will need to come here.

      </ul>
      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <p>
        The programming page of my site will be an overview of my programming creations. People will come to this site to view, and potentially uses, the programs I have developed. They will be able to see the areas I am skilled in, and the areas I am working to improve in. They may even come to know if I am a good fit for a programming job they may need done.
        <br><br>
        When people come to this site, they will expect to find answers to various questions. What programming languages do I know? What type of programs have I created? Are the programs I’ve created complex or simple? Are the programs I’ve created useful or too niche? These, and many more, questions I hope get answered by this page.
        <br><br>
        My hope is to provide some interaction for the user. This might include reading about the program, viewing some of its code, seeing it inaction, or even using the program I’ve created. By giving the user some of these opportunities to interact, I hope to draw them in and show they why they should hire me as a developer.
        <br><br>
        As with the photography page, I hope to make the page as intuitive as possible. I don’t want to be overbearing with my hints to the point where the page is cluttered with text not relevant to the content being shown. I want this page to feel as though no matter where you click, you’ll experience something new.
        <br><br>
        Visitors will come to my site to view a compilation of my work. Nowhere else on the internet will users be able to see all my programming creations. If someone wants to learn about me and what I’ve done, this will be where they need to come.
