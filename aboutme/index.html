            <h2>Josh Spendlove</h2>
            
            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Josh. I've been married for 5 years to my best friend, and we have two energetic boys, the oldest being 4 and the younger 2. We have two tortoises, one Russian and one Red-Footed, as well as one dog, a Mini Schnauzer.</p> 

            <p>I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, and I recently received my associate's in Computer Programming. I currently work as a QA tester for a smart home company, but my hope is to move up and become one of their developers.
            </p>

            <p>My wife and I have been members of the Church all our lives, though we've both solidified our testimonies more fully in recent years. We love our Savior deeply and are grateful for His gospel.</p>

            <p>I'm excited to learn with you all this semester, and hope that we can all have a great experience.</p>
